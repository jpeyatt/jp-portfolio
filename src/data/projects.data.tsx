As Front End Developers, we tend to lean heavy on these as they are convenient and allow us to iterate through work quicker. But with that comes the burden and responsibility to keep our skills dusted off for when the inevitable time comes that weâ€™ll need to rely on them. This project was a reason to do just that for myself!',
