## Justin's React Portfolio

You can see this app live [here](https://justinpeyatt.netlify.app/)

## Goals of this project

I wanted to create my own portfolio site, from scratch, with a few goals in mind:
### No external libraries (excluding React)
There are great libraries/frameworks out there that I would definitely use in a typical production app (over "from-scratch" code), but those can often become a crutch that allows us to forget or even to never learn what's going on behind the scenes. 
I will not be using any external libraries/frameworks for any JavaScript features or CSS styling. This was both for the advantage of showcasing raw JS/CSS skills and to have a purpose to brush up those skills. 
### React skills
Since I'm still new-ish to React, this seemed like a suitable project to work knowledge.  Architecture-wise, I chose to use Function Components. 

## Things to come
### `Tests`
Unit tests with Jest
Integration tests with Selium

## `Projects`
Project Card for screenshot/summary
Project Modal for more details

## Feedback

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions on improvement. Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:justinpeyatt@gmail.com)!
